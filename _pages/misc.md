In my spare time, I enjoy watching movies, lifting weights, bouldering, hiking, and playing golf. I’m also into esports, including League of Legends, competitive programming, chess, and GeoGuessr.

I also like reading Japanese literature and math textbooks. I think a lot about our future with AI, especially how we treat AI morally and legally. Happy to chat about any of these!
