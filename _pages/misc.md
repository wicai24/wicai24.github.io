In my spare time, I enjoy watching movies, lifting weights, or going bouldering. I also like going hiking and playing golf with friends. I'm into a lot of esports including League of Legends, competitive programming, and geoguessr.

I also plan on going back to reading more Japanese literature, psychoanalysis, and math textbooks. I enjoy thinking about our future with AI, especially how we think about AI morally and legally. Happy to chat about these!
