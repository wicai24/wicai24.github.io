In my spare time, I enjoy watching movies, lifting weights, and going bouldering. I also like hiking and playing golf with friends. I’m into esports as well, including League of Legends, competitive programming, and GeoGuessr.

I’m planning to get back into reading more Japanese literature and math textbooks. I also enjoy thinking about the future of AI, especially how we treat AI morally and legally. Happy to chat about any of these!
