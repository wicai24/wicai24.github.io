In my spare time, I enjoy watching movies, lifting weights, bouldering, hiking, and playing golf. I’m also into esports, including League of Legends, competitive programming, chess, and GeoGuessr.

I’m planning to get back into reading more Japanese literature and math textbooks. I also enjoy thinking about our future with AI, especially how we treat AI morally and legally. Happy to chat about any of these!
