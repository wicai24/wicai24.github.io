In my spare time, I enjoy lifting weights, bouldering, swimming, and playing golf. I’m also into esports, including League of Legends, competitive programming, chess, and GeoGuessr.

I like watching thriller and sci-fi films. I also read Japanese and French literature and math textbooks. I think a lot about our future with AI, especially how we treat it morally and legally. Happy to chat about any of these!
