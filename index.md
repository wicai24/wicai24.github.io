Hi, I'm currently a Research Fellow at Anthropic focused on AI safety and security. I'm also finishing my MS and BA at UC Berkeley advised by Dawn Song. 

I currently live in Berkeley and would love to chat about AI safety and LLM post-training. Recently I've been interested in various ways to defend against adversarial distillation on LLMs and in designing more robust and efficient probe-based methods for detecting misuse.
