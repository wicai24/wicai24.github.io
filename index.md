Hi, this is Will. This is a space to refresh and share knowledge relevant to frontier AI research and engineering. Most posts will include high-level conceptual explanations alongside pytorch implementation.

If you’d like to ask questions or discuss, feel free to reach me at [wicai@berkeley.edu](mailto:wicai@berkeley.edu). 

In the future, I may also use this site to share updates on my research, study notes from technical textbooks, or reflections on my other hobbies, depending on my availability and the accountability or benefits this blog provides.
