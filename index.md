Hi, I'm currently a Research Fellow at Anthropic focused on AI safety and security. I'm also finishing my MS and BA at UC Berkeley advised by Dawn Song. 

I would love to chat or collaborate on AI safety and LLM post-training research. Recently I've been interested in various ways to defend against adversarial distillation on LLMs and in designing more robust and efficient probe-based methods for detecting misuse.
