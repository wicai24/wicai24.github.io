Hi, I'm currently a Research Fellow at Anthropic focused on AI safety and security. I'm also finishing my MS and BA at UC Berkeley advised by Dawn Song. 

I would love to chat or collaborate on AI safety or RL-related projects. Recently, I’ve been interested in defenses against adversarial distillation in LLMs, robust and efficient probe-based methods for misuse detection, and reducing entropy collapse in RL training.
