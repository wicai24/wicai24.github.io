excerpt: "Why and what I post."
---

I've always been reluctant to post publicly out of fear of making mistakes, but I think it's good to step out of that comfort zone. Hopefully this also keeps me accountable on side projects. Not sure how it'll go, but let's see!

I plan to mostly write about three seperate things: **my thoughts on a future with AI**, **learning different topics not directly relevant to my research** and **discovering new vulnerabilities of AI systems**.

My tentative learning list includes Haskell and category theory, generative modeling techniques, and philosophy or linguistics on the limits of language.
