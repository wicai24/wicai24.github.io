excerpt: "Why and what I post."
---

I've always been reluctant to post publicly out of fear of making mistakes, but I think it's good to step out of that comfort zone. Hopefully this also keeps me accountable on side projects. Not sure how it'll go, but let's see!

I plan to mostly write about two seperate things: **my thoughts on a future with AI** and **learning different topics not directly relevant to my research**. A tentative list includes haskell and category theory, techniques of generative modeling, and probably some philosophy/linguistic discussions on limit of language.
